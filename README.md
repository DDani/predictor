=======
Predictor
=========

Fast and efficient recommendations and predictions using Redis.

Originally forked and based on [Recommendify](https://github.com/paulasmuth/recommendify) by Paul Asmuth, so a huge thanks to him for his contributions to Recommendify. Predictor has been almost completely rewritten to
* Be more performant and efficient by using Redis for most logic
* Provide predictions as well as item similarities (supports both cases of "Users that liked this book also liked ..." and "You liked these x books, so you might also like...")
